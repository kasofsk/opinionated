Terraform configurations for provisioning Forgejo resources.

## Structure

- `modules/forgejo-init/` — Reusable module: creates users, repos, labels, collaborator permissions
- `test/` — Test environment config, references the module with test-specific variables (`test.tfvars`)
- `dev/` — Dev environment config

## Provider

Uses **Lerentis/gitea** Terraform provider. This provider requires username+password auth (not token-only) for the admin user.

## Labels are created via `curl`

The gitea provider has no label resource. Labels (status labels like `on-deck`, `blocked`, `rework`, `revoked`, etc.) are provisioned via `null_resource` + `local-exec` curl commands. If you change label names, also update `JobState` string conversions in `crates/types/src/lib.rs`.

## Forgejo app.ini

`forgejo/app.ini` is the base Forgejo configuration. It's copied into `.data/forgejo/gitea/conf/` by `init.sh` before first boot. Includes CORS configuration so the graph viewer (served at `:8080`) can make cross-origin API calls to Forgejo (`:3000`). Also enables Forgejo Actions (`[actions]` section).

## Three sidecar service accounts

The sidecar uses three Forgejo identities for audit trail clarity:
- **`workflow-sync`** (variable: `sidecar_login`) — label/dep management
- **`workflow-dispatcher`** (variable: `dispatcher_login`) — assignee/comment management
- **`workflow-reviewer`** (variable: `reviewer_login`) — PR reviews, merge, escalation comments

All are provisioned by the `forgejo-init` module and added as repo collaborators with write permission.

## Human reviewer account

A **`you`** user (variable: `human_login`) is provisioned as a regular Forgejo account with write collaborator access. This is the escalation target for the automated reviewer — when it decides a PR needs human attention, it adds `you` as a PR reviewer. Log in at `localhost:3000` with the configured password to manually review and merge PRs.

## No webhooks

Webhooks were removed in favor of the CDC pipeline. The sidecar learns about Forgejo changes via the CDC process reading Forgejo's SQLite DB directly, not via webhook callbacks. The CDC also detects merged PRs via SQLite queries (`pull_request` table with `has_merged=1` and body matching `Closes #N`).

## Worker permissions

Workers are created as Forgejo users with `write` collaborator access on the repo. This gives them permission to push branches, create PRs, and comment on issues, but NOT admin/merge access. Three workers are provisioned by default: `worker-aria`, `worker-blake`, `worker-casey`.

## Running Terraform

Always use `scripts/init.sh` rather than running Terraform directly — the script handles admin user/token creation, fresh Terraform state, worker password setup, sidecar token provisioning, and `.sidecar.env` generation.

## Variables requiring secrets

- `forgejo_admin_token` — passed via `TF_VAR_forgejo_admin_token` env var (created by init.sh)
- `forgejo_admin_password` — passed via `TF_VAR_forgejo_admin_password`
- `sidecar_password` — passed via `TF_VAR_sidecar_password`
- `dispatcher_password` — passed via `TF_VAR_dispatcher_password`
- `reviewer_password` — passed via `TF_VAR_reviewer_password`
- `human_password` — passed via `TF_VAR_human_password`
