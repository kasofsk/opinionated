# Workflow demo fixtures

Two fixture files that show different dependency topologies.
Seed them into a Forgejo repo with the `worker-cli seed` command.

```
worker-cli \
  --forgejo-url http://localhost:3000 \
  --forgejo-token <TOKEN> \
  seed owner/repo fixtures/chain.json
```

## chain — linear dependency chain

Each job must complete before the next can start.

```
setup
  └─► schema
        └─► api
              └─► tests
                    └─► docs
                          └─► release
```

## hub — hub-and-spoke with multiple work streams

Four independent work streams (infra, auth, frontend, data) run in parallel.
They converge on a central integration milestone, which gates the final release.

```
infra-plan ──► infra-terraform ──► infra-ci ──────────────┐
                                                           │

## How seeding works

The `seed` command does two passes:

1. **Create issues** — each fixture job becomes a Forgejo issue.
   The temporary body is created without dependency markers so Forgejo
   assigns a real issue number.

2. **Patch bodies** — once all issue numbers are known, each issue that
   has dependencies gets its body updated with an HTML comment:

   ```
   <!-- workflow:deps:3,7,12 -->
   ```

   The CDC process detects the change and publishes a snapshot. The
   sidecar consumer picks it up and wires the edges in the task graph.

The task graph enforces DAG invariants: if any dependency would form a
cycle the sidecar rejects it and posts a warning comment on the issue.
